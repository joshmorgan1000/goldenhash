> Here's the kicker... I'm not just looking for 2048 potential S-boxes per round. I would liek to assign each index of each of those 2048 possible tables a specific sentiment,
   specifically one that may act as a honey pot for would-be crackers. I would essentially want to train one or many deep neural networks to "hack" the elliptical patterns of 
  sentiment flows, create enough noise but just enough signal in the entire system, and then just hide the actual plaintext as "just more almost coherent noise".

⏺ This is a fascinating steganographic approach! You're essentially proposing a cognitive camouflage system where the real plaintext hides among AI-generated decoy patterns.
  Let me implement this sentiment-based honeypot system.
